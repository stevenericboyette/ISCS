Icarus Starship Command Simulator

Thank you for downloading the Icarus Starship Command Simulator source code which is provided under GNU GPL-3.0-or-later.

Icarus Starship Command Simulator is based on the Doom 3 source code which was released under GNU GPL-3.0-or-later.

The game assets are currently not open source but if you would like to try the game out (and see your changes actually in the game) then you can buy the game here:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/620170/Icarus_Starship_Command_Simulator/

The game runs on at least Windows Vista/7/8.1/10/11.

I have managed to get the source to compile in Visual Studio 2022 and I would recommend you use the same version or a newer version to open the Visual Studio solution file.


An error you might encounter during compilation is:
'dxerr.h': No such file or directory


This is telling you to download:
Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)

You should continue to be able to download and install this old SDK from Microsoft for the foreseeable future (although they move it around every once in a while so just google it).
